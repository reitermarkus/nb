# `nb`

> Minimal and reusable non-blocking I/O layer

This project is developed and maintained by the [HAL team][team].

## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/nb)

The ultimate goal of this crate is *code reuse*. With this crate you can
write *core* I/O APIs that can then be adapted to operate in either blocking
or non-blocking manner. Furthermore those APIs are not tied to a particular
asynchronous model and can be adapted to work with the `futures` model or
with the `async` / `await` model.

### Core idea

The [`WouldBlock`](enum.Error.html) error variant signals that the operation
can't be completed *right now* and would need to block to complete.
[`WouldBlock`](enum.Error.html) is a special error in the sense that it's not
*fatal*; the operation can still be completed by retrying again later.

[`nb::Result`](type.Result.html) is based on the API of
[`std::io::Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html),
which has a `WouldBlock` variant in its
[`ErrorKind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/enum.ErrorKind.html).

We can map [`WouldBlock`](enum.Error.html) to different blocking and
non-blocking models:

- In blocking mode, [`WouldBlock`](enum.Error.html) means try again right
  now, i.e. busy waiting.
- In `async` mode, [`WouldBlock`](enum.Error.html) means
  [`Poll::Pending`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Pending).
